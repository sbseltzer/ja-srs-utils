# Japanese SRS Utilities

Formatting utilities for Japanese SRS cards.

I've started this with Anki in mind, but I hope to have this supported for other SRS systems that are capable of it.

# Installation

If you haven't installed yet, start by cloning or downloading the repository. If you're updating, either re-download, or pull the latest changes.

Installation instructions will differ from SRS to SRS, but any that support HTML/CSS/Javascript customization should be compatible with a little tweaking.
