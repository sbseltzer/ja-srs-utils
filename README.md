# Japanese SRS Utilities
Formatting utilities Japanese SRS cards.

I've started this with Anki in mind, but I hope to port this to other SRS systems that support HTML/CSS/Javascript.

# Installation & Updates

If you haven't installed yet, start by cloning or downloading the repository. If you're updating, either re-download, or pull the latest changes.

## Anki Installation

Note: These instructions currently assume you are using the default media directory.

#### IMPORTANT: Always close Anki before installing/updating! If you don't, you run the risk of corrupting your database! 

### Linux

Navigate to the repository directory and run `install.sh`.

### Windows

If you already have a Linux shell emulator (such as Cygwin or Mintty) go ahead and run `install.sh` using that. Otherwise, install [Git](https://git-scm.org) which includes one for you. Make sure during installation that you allow it to be the default program for running `.sh` files. Then refer to the Linux instructions above.

### OSX
