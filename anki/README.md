# Anki Instructions

## Installation

#### Note: These instructions currently assume you are using the default Anki userdata directory and only have one user set up for Anki.

#### IMPORTANT: Always close Anki before installing/updating! If you don't, you run the risk of corrupting your database! 

For this to work in desktop environments, you will need to install the [JS Booster](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1280253613) addon for Anki.

### Linux

Run `install.sh "My User Name"` replacing "My User Name" with the actual username you have for Anki.

### Windows

If you already have a Linux shell emulator (such as Cygwin or Mintty) go ahead and run `install.sh` using that. Otherwise, install [Git](https://git-scm.org) which includes one for you. Make sure during installation that you allow it to be the default program for running `.sh` files. Then refer to the Linux instructions above.

### OSX
